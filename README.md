# RAG_STACK_TECHIQUES

RAG Stack with LangChain and Gemini:
This repository contains a collection of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, showcasing various techniques for building robust and scalable question-answering systems. The project is built using LangChain as the primary orchestration framework, leverages Google Gemini as the Large Language Model (LLM), and utilizes FAISS for efficient vector storage and similarity search.

🚀 Features:
 * Modular Pipelines: Explore different RAG architectures, including simple and advanced configurations.
 * LangChain Integration: See practical examples of using LangChain's core components like chains, agents, and custom tools.
 * Gemini LLM: Learn how to integrate and use Google's powerful Gemini models for generation and reasoning.
 * FAISS Vector Store: Efficiently manage and search document embeddings for fast retrieval.
 * Data Ingestion: Includes scripts and notebooks for processing various data formats (e.g., PDFs, text files, web pages).
 * Evaluation Metrics: (Optional) Code for evaluating the performance of different RAG pipelines.
🛠 Getting Started:

Prerequisites:
 * Python 3.9+
 * An API key for the Google Gemini API.
 * 
Installation:
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

 * Install the dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 * Set up your environment variables:
   Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Google API key.
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

📈 Usage Examples
1. Simple RAG Pipeline
To run the basic RAG pipeline, which ingests data, builds a FAISS index, and answers questions:
python pipelines/simple_rag.py --question "What is RAG?"

2. Advanced RAG with Tools
(Optional) If you have a more complex pipeline with agents and tools, you can add a section here to explain how to run it.
python pipelines/advanced_rag.py --query "Summarize the document and tell me the author."
